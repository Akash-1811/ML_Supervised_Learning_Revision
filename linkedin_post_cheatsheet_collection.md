# 📚 ML/AI Model Cheatsheet Collection: Quick Revision Guide for Data Scientists

Hello connections! 👋

I'm excited to share a comprehensive collection of machine learning cheatsheets I've compiled for quick revision. Whether you're preparing for interviews, refreshing your knowledge, or looking for implementation guidelines, these resources cover everything you need.

## What's included in each cheatsheet:

Each model cheatsheet follows a consistent format with:
- 📝 **Explanation**: Clear, concise theoretical foundation
- 💻 **Implementation**: Ready-to-use Python code snippets
- 📊 **Model Evaluation**: Metrics and evaluation techniques
- 🔧 **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimization strategies
- ✅ **Best Practices**: Tips from industry experience
- 🎯 **Interview Questions & Answers**: Common questions with detailed responses

## Models Covered:

### Regression Models:
- **Linear Regression**: The foundation of predictive modeling with MSE loss function and R-squared evaluation
- **Polynomial Regression**: For capturing non-linear relationships with degree optimization techniques
- **Regularization Techniques**: L1 (Lasso), L2 (Ridge), and Elastic Net with practical implementation

### Classification Models:
- **Logistic Regression**: Probabilistic classification with logistic function and regularization options
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Non-parametric, instance-based learning with distance metrics explained
- **Decision Trees**: Rule-based classification/regression with information gain and Gini impurity

### Ensemble Methods:
- **Random Forest**: Bagging ensemble with feature importance and OOB error estimation
- **XGBoost**: Gradient boosting implementation with advanced features and optimization techniques

### Time Series Analysis:
- **Comprehensive guide**: From data preparation to advanced forecasting techniques
